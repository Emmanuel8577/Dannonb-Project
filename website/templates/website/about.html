          The Dannonmbi Care Foundation is the nonprofit arm of the Dannon
          Group, committed to empowering individuals and families affected by
          crises and natural disasters. Founded to bridge the gap between
          immediate relief and long-term recovery, the Foundation focuses on
          trauma recovery, resilience-building, and community development,
          particularly in underserved communities across Nigeria.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          Since its establishment, the foundation has delivered impactful
          programmes including Annual Grants for large-scale initiatives and
          grassroots projects, as well as Rapid Response Grants, activated
          within 48 hours of crises to provide critical aid. These programmes
          have directly benefited communities in regions like Kaduna and
          Maiduguri, offering culturally sensitive and community-driven
          intervention that have helped thousands recover, rebuild, and thrive.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          By integrating funding with technical support, collaborating with
          local partners, and maintain a commitment to transparency, the
          Dannonmbi Care Foundation ensures sustainable and measurable outcomes.
          Looking ahead, we aspire to expand our reach by establishing trauma
          recovery centers, enhancing data-driven solutions, and fostering
          stronger partnerships. We invite you to join us - whether through
          donations, volunteering, or collaborations – as we build resilient
          communities across Nigeria.

                Dannonmbi Care Foundation works to strengthen the capacity of
                families and individuals affected by crises and natural
                disasters, helping them recover from trauma and rebuild their
                lives. Through a network of local and international partners,
                including Non-Governmental Organisations, Community-Based
                Organisations, Government agencies, Faith-Based Organisations,
                and Corporate Partners, we ensure that the right support is
                provided where it can have the greatest impact. Our approach is
                built on collaboration with diverse stakeholders, from academic
                institutions and mental health networks to youth-led
                organisations and volunteer groups. We work closely with local
                community leaders and traditional rulers to ensure our
                programmes are culturally relevant, effective, and aligned with
                the needs of the communities we serve. The Foundation also
                collaborates with multilateral agencies, like the United Nations
                and other global aid organisations, boosting our efforts and
                mobilizing broader support. These partnerships enhance our
                capacity to respond effectively and ensure the sustainability of
                our programmes.

                  Partnership and Collaboration are vital to fulfilling the
                  Dannonmbi Care Foundation’s mission of building resilient
                  communities and supporting individuals and families in
                  recovery and resilience after crises. We believe that
                  meaningful collaborations allow us to achieve greater impact,
                  scale up efforts, and address complex challenges requiring
                  multiple stakeholders' coordinated action. Through strategic
                  partnerships, we harness collective strengths to deliver
                  integrated, culturally relevant solutions tailored to the
                  needs of underserved communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the forefront of our approach is identifying strategic
                  needs and pursuing partners whose goals and values align with
                  ours. Through a transparent and rigorous due diligence
                  process, we assess compatibility and establish clear
                  expectations to ensure successful collaboration. We then
                  cultivate close working relationships with our partners to
                  design and implement impactful programmes, ensuring constant
                  communication, shared accountability, and adaptability to meet
                  changing needs. Post-implementation evaluations enable us to
                  reflect, learn, and refine our strategies for future
                  initiatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While collaborations offer immense benefits, we remain mindful
                  of potential challenges, such as communication breakdowns,
                  lack of commitment, and incompatibility between partners. To
                  address these risks, we prioritise clear communication,
                  transparency, and mutual accountability throughout the
                  collaboration and partnership process. By doing so, we ensure
                  that our partnerships remain productive, sustainable, and
                  aligned with our organisation’s mission.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through these efforts, we aim to enhance the quality of our
                  programmes, streamline operations, and expand our reach to new
                  regions, beneficiaries, and services. Whether through joint
                  programmes, advocacy, or resource-sharing, our partnerships
                  strengthen our ability to create lasting change in the lives
                  of those we serve.

                <li><strong> Resource Partners: </strong></li>
                <p>
                  These partners include individuals, organisations, or
                  institutions that contribute financial or material resources
                  to support our programmes. They play a vital role in enabling
                  us to deliver trauma-informed care, resilience-building
                  initiatives, and community development projects. Their
                  contributions not only strengthen our operational capacity but
                  also allow us to respond swiftly and effectively during
                  emergencies. Resource partnerships often involve corporate
                  sponsorships, philanthropic contributions, and in-kind
                  donations such as equipment or essential supplies, ensuring we
                  can address both immediate and long-term community needs.

                <li><strong> Advocacy and Network Partners: </strong></li>
                <p>
                  Advocacy and Network partners help advance our mission by
                  promoting shared objectives, raising awareness, and driving
                  policy change. These partnerships include coalitions,
                  alliances, and networks at local, national, and global levels.
                  Together, we co-develop campaigns, participate in advocacy
                  events, and influence decision-makers to prioritise issues
                  like trauma recovery, mental health, and community resilience.
                  Partnerships with global aid organisations and regional
                  alliances have also mobilized collective action to address
                  systematic challenges.

                <li><strong> Implementation Partners: </strong></li>
                <p>
                  We work alongside grassroots organisations, NGOs, and CBOs to
                  implement programmes effectively in underserved communities.
                  These partners provide local expertise, ensuring that our
                  interventions are contextually relevant and impactful. Beyond
                  delivering programmes, implementation partners help foster
                  trust within communities and promote sustained engagement. For
                  example, they facilitate training programmes, deliver mental
                  health services, or organise resilience-building workshops
                  that directly benefit the target populations. Additionally, we
                  support these partners with technical assistance and
                  capacity-building efforts to enhance their effectiveness and
                  scalability.

                  Our Learning and Innovation partnerships encourage mutual
                  growth, continuous improvement, and the adoption of innovative
                  solutions. By collaborating with academic institutions,
                  research organisations, and other thought leaders, we remain
                  at the forefront of emerging best practices in trauma
                  recovery, resilience-building, and community development.
                  These partnerships often involve joint research projects,
                  knowledge-sharing forums, and the creation of new tools or
                  methodologies. As an example, working with universities and
                  research centers allows us to analyse programme outcomes,
                  refine intervention models, and ensure evidence-based
                  decision-making.

                  At Dannonmbi Care Foundation, we focus on providing
                  trauma-informed care, developing resilience-building
                  programmes, and advocating for policy changes that better
                  prepare communities for future crises. By continuously
                  learning from our projects and refining our strategies, we
                  remain committed to creating lasting impact, supporting
                  communities on their journey towards self-sufficiency, and
                  addressing their unique challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At Dannonmbi Care Foundation, grant-making is more than
                  funding—it’s a pathway to empowering communities, fostering
                  resilience, and driving sustainable recovery. Aligned with our
                  mission to create thriving communities, our approach
                  emphasizes transparency, accountability, collaboration, and
                  adaptability while addressing both urgent and long-term needs
                  across trauma recovery, resilience-building, and community
                  development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our grant-making process is categorized into two key areas:
                  Annual Grants and Rapid Response Grants.
                </p>

                <li><strong> Annual Grants:</strong></li>

                <p>
                  Annual Grants form the backbone of our funding efforts,
                  enabling impactful, sustainable projects across Nigeria. Each
                  year, we publish a Call for Concept Notes, inviting eligible
                  organisations to submit proposals. Our process is rigorous,
                  transparent, and inclusive, involving eligibility screening,
                  proposal assessment, and board-level reviews. Feedback is
                  provided to promote trust, learning, and continuous
                  improvement. Annual Grants are further divided into Main
                  Grants and Community Support Funds.
                </p>

                <li><strong> Main Grants: </strong></li>
                <p>
                  These large-scale grants are available to Non-Governmental
                  Organisations (NGOs) and Community-Based Organisations (CBOs)
                  nationwide. They focus on initiatives such as trauma recovery,
                  mental health support, and resilience-building programmes.
                  Applications are evaluated for alignment with our mission,
                  feasibility, and potential for sustainable impact. A
                  structured timeline ensures decisions are finalized within six
                  months of submission, promoting clarity and efficiency.
                </p>
                <li><strong> Community Support Funds: </strong></li>
                <p>
                  Tailored for grassroots organisations, particularly in Kaduna
                  and Maiduguri—our priority states—these smaller grants address
                  culturally relevant, locally driven projects. Beyond financial
                  support, we provide technical and institutional assistance to
                  enhance capacity and foster community engagement. These grants
                  aim to build long-term self-sufficiency while addressing
                  immediate needs.
                </p>
                <li><strong> Rapid Response Grants: </strong></li>

                <p>
                  During crises, our Rapid Response Grants enable swift
                  humanitarian relief, activated within 48 hours of an
                  emergency. These grants address urgent needs such as mental
                  health care, emergency supplies, and temporary shelter while
                  laying the groundwork for long-term recovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We collaborate closely with local leaders, NGOs, and
                  multilateral organisations to ensure effective and accountable
                  delivery. Guided by data analysis and risk assessments, our
                  responses are targeted, efficient, and adaptable. Post-crisis
                  reflections allow us to assess strengths, address weaknesses,
                  and improve future protocols. Interventions are implemented
                  within 30 days, with continuous evaluations informing future
                  actions.
                </p>

                <p>
                  At every stage, we prioritise transparency, accountability,
                  and learning. Feedback mechanisms, data reviews, and regular
                  assessments refine our strategies, ensuring every project
                  achieves measurable, lasting results. By embedding these
                  principles into all our grant schemes, we empower communities
                  to heal, rebuild, and thrive for generations to come.
