          Skills development plays a pivotal role in driving sustainable
          development and economic resilience. For Nigeria, equipping
          individuals with market-relevant skills, fostering entrepreneurship,
          and removing barriers to access are critical strategies for unlocking
          the nation's vast potential. Addressing challenges within the
          education system and enhancing vocational and technical training can
          bridge the gap between education and employability, setting the stage
          for a more inclusive and prosperous future.
