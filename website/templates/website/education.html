          Education is a cornerstone for national development, yet Nigeria
          continues to face challenges in providing equitable access to quality
          education. Millions of children are out of school, and the system
          struggles with issues such as inadequate infrastructure, teacher
          shortages, and poor learning outcomes. Addressing these challenges
          through targeted interventions is key to unlocking the potential of
          Nigeria’s youthful population.

      <strong> The State of Education in Nigeria </strong>

      <strong> Out-of-School Children: </strong>
    </li>
    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li class="mt-3 lead">
        According to UNICEF, Nigeria has the highest number of out-of-school
        children globally, with over 10 million children aged 5–14 not attending
        school. This issue is more pronounced in northern Nigeria, where
        cultural and economic factors contribute to low enrollment rates.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-3 lead">
        Girls are particularly affected, facing barriers such as early marriage,
        child labor, and gender discrimination.

    </ul>

      <strong> Access to Education: </strong>
    </li>
    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li class="mt-3 lead">
        While primary school enrollment has improved over the years, many
        children do not transition to secondary or tertiary education due to
        financial constraints, long distances to schools, and inadequate
        facilities.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!--  -->
    <li class="mt-3 h5">
      <strong> Quality of Education: </strong>
    </li>
    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li class="mt-3 lead">
        Learning outcomes remain low, with many children unable to read or
        perform basic arithmetic despite attending school.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-3 lead">
        Teacher quality is a major issue, as many educators lack the proper
        training, and teacher-student ratios are often overwhelming, especially
        in public schools.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <li class="mt-3 h5">
      <strong> Infrastructure Deficits: </strong>
    </li>
    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li class="mt-3 lead">
        Many schools lack essential facilities such as classrooms, desks,
        toilets, and electricity, especially in rural areas.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-3 lead">
        Overcrowding is a persistent issue, with some schools accommodating far
        more students than their capacity.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <li class="mt-3 h5">
      <strong> Impact of Conflicts and Emergencies: </strong>
    </li>
    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li class="mt-3 lead">
        Armed conflicts, especially in the Northeast, have disrupted education
        for millions. Schools have been destroyed, and many children are too
        afraid to return to classrooms.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-3 lead">
        Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps struggle to provide adequate
        educational services for displaced children.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-5 lead mb-5">
      Education is a powerful tool for transforming lives and communities. By addressing access, quality, and equity issues, Nigeria can ensure that every child has the opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute meaningfully to society. A collaborative approach involving government, Dannonmbi, and local communities is essential to achieving this vision
