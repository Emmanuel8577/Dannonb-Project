      Nigeria, with its vast population of over 200 million people, faces
      numerous health challenges shaped by factors such as rapid urbanization,
      poverty, unequal healthcare distribution, and a high burden of diseases.
      The nation's healthcare system is a mix of public and private services,
      with a majority of the population relying on government facilities for
      access to healthcare.

          Malaria remains one of the leading causes of illness and death in
          Nigeria, particularly among children under five and pregnant women.
        </li>
        <li class="mt-3 lead">
          Tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS also significantly affect the
          population, despite ongoing awareness and treatment programs.
        </li>
        <li class="mt-3 lead">
          Nigeria has made progress in reducing polio cases, but vaccination
          coverage still faces challenges, especially in rural areas.

        <li class="mt-3 lead">
          Maternal mortality rates in Nigeria are among the highest globally,
          primarily due to complications such as hemorrhage, sepsis, and unsafe
          abortions.
        </li>
        <li class="mt-3 lead">
          Neonatal and infant mortality rates are concerning, often linked to
          poor access to skilled birth attendants, malnutrition, and inadequate
          neonatal care.

        <li class="mt-3 lead">
          Lifestyle-related diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity
          are on the rise, particularly in urban centers, due to changing diets
          and sedentary lifestyles.
        </li>
        <li class="mt-3 lead">
          Cancer, particularly breast and cervical cancer, is another emerging
          health concern with limited screening and treatment facilities.

        <strong> Access to Healthcare: </strong>

      <ul class="mt-3">
        <li class="mt-3 lead">
          Access to quality healthcare services varies widely between urban and
          rural areas, with rural regions often experiencing shortages of
          skilled health professionals, medicines, and basic infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li class="mt-3 lead">
          Health insurance coverage is low, with most Nigerians paying
          out-of-pocket for medical services, which increases financial barriers
          to accessing care.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-5 lead">
        While Nigeria faces significant health challenges, ongoing efforts by
        the government, NGOs, and international partners hold promise for
        improving healthcare delivery. Addressing gaps in access, funding, and
        workforce development will be critical in ensuring better health
        outcomes for all Nigerians.
